<h2>Note.</h2>
<br>

<p class="continue">Herr Hermann Sudermann has achieved surprising success in passing from
novel-writing to dramatic authorship. He has a style of the utmost
distinction, and is well skilled in technique. His masterpiece,
&quot;Heimat,&quot; is absolutely original. No play has ever produced a more
impressive effect upon German audiences. When it ceases to be
performed, it will still hold a permanent and important place in the
libraries of dramatic literature. Though a psychological study, there
is no concentration of attention upon morbid conditions. All these have
passed before the play begins. There is no passion for mere passion's
sake. Its development proceeds from the energies of circumstances and
character.

Herr Sudermann, unlike some of the new dramatists, is not lacking in
humor; and the snobbishness, stuffy etiquette, and scandal-mongering of
a provincial town are well illustrated by the minor characters. Into
this atmosphere comes the whirlwind from the outer world with fatal
effect. It is scarcely possible to conceive more varied and intense
emotions naturally and even inevitably evolved from the action of a
single day. The value of the drama lies in the sharp contrasts between
the New and the Old, alternately commanding, in their strife, the
adhesion of the spectator or reader. The preparation for the return of
&quot;The Prodigal Daughter&quot; occupies an entire act, and invests her
entrance with an interest which increases until the tremendous climax.
Yet the proud martinet father commands our respect and sympathy; and
the Pastor, in his enlightened self-conquest, is the antithesis alike
of the narrowness and lawlessness of parent and child, and remains the
hero of the swift tragedy.

It is not uncommon that the scrupulousness attending circumstances
where partiality would be a natural impulse, makes criticism even
unusually exacting. It is believed that in this spirit the present
translation may be somewhat confidently characterized as being both
spirited and faithful.</p>

<h2>ACT I.</h2>
<br>
<p class="hang1"><span class="sc">Scene</span>. <i>Living-room in house of</i> <span class="sc">Lieutenant-Colonel Schwartze</span>,
<i>furnished in simple and old-fashioned style. Left, at back, a glass
door with white curtains through which the dining-room is seen. There
is also a hall door, through which a staircase to the upper story is
visible. Right, a corner window, with white curtains, surrounded by
ivy. Left, a door to the </i> <span class="sc">Lieutenant-Colonel's </span><i>room. Steel engravings
of a religious and patriotic character, in tarnished gold frames,
photographs of military groups, and cases of butterflies on the walls.
Right, over the sofa, among other pictures, is the portrait of the
first Mrs. Schwartze, young and charming, in the costume of the
sixties. Behind the sofa, an old-fashioned desk. Before the window, a
small table with workbox and hand sewing-machine. At the back, between
the doors, an old-fashioned tall clock. In the left-hand corner, a
stand with dried grasses; in front, a table with a small aquarium.
Left, in front, a corner sofa with a small pipe-cupboard behind it. A
stove with a stuffed bird on it; and behind, a bookcase with a bust of
the old Emperor William.</i></p>

<h3>THERESA.</h3>
<p class="normal">Miss Marie!</p>
<br>
<h3>MARIE.</h3>
<p class="normal">Well!</p>
<br>
<h3>THERESA.</h3>
<p class="normal">Is your father still lying down?</p>
<br>
<h3>MARIE.</h3>
<p class="normal">What's the matter? Has any one called?</p>
<br>
<h3>THERESA.</h3>
<p class="normal">No, but-- There! Look at that! [<i>Producing a magnificent mass of
flowers</i>.]</p>
<br>
<h3>MARIE.</h3>
<p class="normal">Good Heavens! Take it to my room quickly, or papa-- But, Theresa, when
the first came yesterday, weren't you told not to let any more be left?</p>
<br>
<h3>THERESA.</h3>
<p class="normal">I'd have sent the florist's boy away if I could, but I was up on the
ladder fixing the flag, and he laid it down and was gone before I could
stop him. My, my, though, they're beautiful! and if I might make a
guess, the Lieutenant--</p>
<br>
<h3>MARIE.</h3>
<p class="normal">You may not make a guess.</p>
<br>
<h3>THERESA.</h3>
<p class="normal">All right, all right. Oh, I know what I wanted to ask. Does the flag
hang well? [<span class="sc">Marie </span><i>looks out, and nods assent</i>.]</p>
<br>
<h3>THERESA.</h3>
<p class="normal">The whole town is full of flags and flowers, and the most expensive
tapestries are hung out of the windows. One would think it was the
King's birthday. And all this fuss is about a stupid Music Festival!
What is this Music Festival, Miss Marie? Is it different from a choral
festival?</p>
<br>
<h3>MARIE.</h3>
<p class="normal">Yes, indeed.</p>
<br>
<h3>THERESA.</h3>
<p class="normal">Is it better?</p>
<br>
<h3>MARIE.</h3>
<p class="normal">Oh, much better!</p>
<br>
<h3>THERESA.</h3>
<p class="normal">Oh, well, if it's better-- [<i>A knock</i>.]</p>
<br>
<h3>MARIE.</h3>
<p class="normal">Come in!

<i>Enter</i> Max.</p>
<br>
<h3>THERESA.</h3>
<p class="normal">Well, <i>now</i> I suppose I can leave the flowers.</p>

<p class="right">[<i>Exit </i><span class="sc">Theresa</span>, <i>laughing</i>.</p>
<br>
<h3>MARIE.</h3>
<p class="normal">You ought to be ashamed of yourself, Max.</p>
<br>
<h3>MAX.</h3>
<p class="normal">What on earth do you mean?</p>
<br>
<h3>MARIE.</h3>
<p class="normal">Aren't these flowers yours?</p>
<br>
<h3>MAX.</h3>
<p class="normal">Good Heavens! I can afford a few pennies for a bunch of violets once in
a while, but this-- Oh, no!</p>
<br>
<h3>MARIE.</h3>
<p class="normal">Nor yesterday's?</p>
<br>
<h3>MAX.</h3>
<p class="normal">No, nor yesterday's. [<span class="sc">Marie </span><i>rings</i>.]</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><i>Enter </i><span class="sc">Theresa</span>.</p>
<br>
<h3>MARIE.</h3>
<p class="normal">Please throw these flowers away.</p>
<br>
<h3>THERESA.</h3>
<p class="normal">What! Throw those beautiful flowers away?</p>
<br>
<h3>MARIE.</h3>
<p class="normal">You are right. The pastor would say, &quot;If God's gifts do not please us,
we must at least take care that they give pleasure to others.&quot; Wouldn't
he?</p>
<br>
<h3>MAX.</h3>
<p class="normal">Probably he would.</p>
<br>
<h3>MARIE.</h3>
<p class="normal">Then you had better take them back to the florist's. Did they come from
Zimmerman's? [<span class="sc">Theresa </span><i>nods</i>.] Well, we'll sell them if we can, and
give the money to Pastor Heffterdingt for his hospital.</p>
<br>
<h3>THERESA.</h3>
<p class="normal">Shall I go now?</p>
<br>
<h3>MARIE.</h3>
<p class="normal">After you have made the coffee. I'll serve it myself. [<i>Exit </i><span class="sc">Theresa</span>.]
These flowers are an insult! I need not tell you, Max, that I have
given no one the shadow of an excuse for such a thing.</p>
<br>
<h3>MAX.</h3>
<p class="normal">I'm very sure of that.</p>
<br>
<h3>MARIE.</h3>
<p class="normal">And papa was so angry. He simply stormed. And I was quiet because I
suspected it was you. If he got hold of the poor fellow, it would go
hard with him.</p>
<br>
<h3>MAX.</h3>
<p class="normal">Do you think it would be any better if I got hold of him?</p>
<br>
<h3>MARIE.</h3>
<p class="normal">What rights have you in the case?</p>
<br>
<h3>MAX.</h3>
<p class="normal">Marie! [<i>Takes her hand</i>.]</p>
<br>
<h3>MARIE.</h3>
<p class="normal">[<i>Gently disengaging herself</i>.] Oh, Max, please--not that. You know
every corner of my heart. But we must think of the proprieties.</p>
<br>
<h3>MAX.</h3>
<p class="normal">Proprieties! Oh, pshaw!</p>
<br>
<h3>MARIE.</h3>
<p class="normal">Well, you know what a world we live in. Here, every one is afraid of
every one else because each depends upon the good opinion of the other.
If a few anonymous flowers can make me talked of, how much more--</p>
<br>
<h3>MAX.</h3>
<p class="normal">Oh, yes, I know.</p>
<br>
<h3>MARIE.</h3>
<p class="normal">[<i>Laying her hand on his shoulder</i>.] Max, you'll speak again to Aunt
Frankie, won't you, about the guaranty<a name="div2Ref_01" href="#div2_01">[1]</a> of your income?</p>
<br>
<h3>MAX.</h3>
<p class="normal">I have already.</p>
<br>
<h3>MARIE.</h3>
<p class="normal">Well?</p>
<br>
<h3>MAX.</h3>
<p class="normal">[<i>Shrugging his shoulders</i>.] As long as she lives, not a penny.</p>
<br>
<h3>MARIE.</h3>
<p class="normal">Then there's only one person who can help us.</p>
<br>
<h3>MAX.</h3>
<p class="normal">Your father?</p>
<br>
<h3>MARIE.</h3>
<p class="normal">No. For Heaven's sake, don't let him hear of it. He might forbid you
the house.</p>
<br>
<h3>MAX.</h3>
<p class="normal">What has he against me?</p>
<br>
<h3>MARIE.</h3>
<p class="normal">You know how he has been since our misfortune. He feels that there is a
blot to be wiped out; and especially now, when the whole town echoes
with music,--when everything recalls Magda.</p>
<br>
<h3>MAX.</h3>
<p class="normal">What if she should come back, some day?</p>
<br>
<h3>MARIE.</h3>
<p class="normal">After twelve years? She will never come.</p>
<p class="right">[<i>Weeps</i>.]</p>
<br>
<h3>MAX.</h3>
<p class="normal">Marie!</p>
<br>
<h3>MARIE.</h3>
<p class="normal">You're right, you're right. I will put it away from me.</p>
<br>
<h3>MAX.</h3>
<p class="normal">But who is the one person who can help us?</p>
<br>
<h3>MARIE.</h3>
<p class="normal">Why, the pastor!</p>
<br>
<h3>MAX.</h3>
<p class="normal">Yes, yes, he might.</p>
<br>
<h3>MARIE.</h3>
<p class="normal">He can do everything. He stirs your very heart--as if-- And then he
seems like a kind of relation. He should have been my brother-in-law.</p>
<br>
<h3>MAX.</h3>
<p class="normal">Yes, but she wouldn't have it so.</p>
<br>
<h3>MARIE.</h3>
<p class="normal">Don't speak angrily, Max. She must have made atonement. [<i>A ring</i>.] Oh,
perhaps this is he.</p>
<br>
<h3>MAX.</h3>
<p class="normal">No, no, I forgot to tell you. Councillor von Keller asked me to bring
him here to-day.</p>
<br>
<h3>MARIE.</h3>
<p class="normal">What does he want?</p>
<br>
<h3>MAX.</h3>
<p class="normal">He wants to interest himself in the missions--no, it's in our home work
particularly, I think. I don't know-- Well, at any rate he wants to
come to the committee meeting tomorrow.</p>
<br>
<h3>MARIE.</h3>
<p class="normal">I'll call father and mother. [<i>Enter</i> <span class="sc">Theresa </span><i>with a card</i>.] Show him
in. [<i>Exit </i><span class="sc">Theresa</span>.] Entertain him until I come back. [<i>Gives him her
hand</i>.] And we'll talk again about the pastor some other time?</p>
<br>
<h3>MAX.</h3>
<p class="normal">In spite of the proprieties?</p>
<br>
<h3>MARIE.</h3>
<p class="normal">Oh, Max, I've been too forward! Haven't I?</p>
<br>
<h3>MAX.</h3>
<p class="normal">Marie!</p>
<br>
<h3>MARIE.</h3>
<p class="normal">No, no--we won't speak of it. Good-by.</p>

<h3>MAX.</h3>
<p class="normal">You must content yourself with me for a few minutes, my dear Von
Keller. [<i>They shake hands</i>.]</p>
<br>
<h3>VON KELLER.</h3>
<p class="normal">With pleasure, my good sir, with pleasure. [<i>Sits</i>.] How our little
town is changed by the festival! It really seems as if we were in the
great world.</p>
<br>
<h3>MAX.</h3>
<p class="normal">[<i>Laughing</i>.] I advise you not to say that aloud.</p>
<br>
<h3>VON KELLER.</h3>
<p class="normal">What did I say? I assure you I did not mean anything. If such a
misunderstanding got abroad--</p>
<br>
<h3>MAX.</h3>
<p class="normal">You have nothing to fear from me!</p>
<br>
<h3>VON KELLER.</h3>
<p class="normal">Oh, of course not. Ah, how much better it would be to know nothing of
the outer world!</p>
<br>
<h3>MAX.</h3>
<p class="normal">How long were you away?</p>
<br>
<h3>VON KELLER.</h3>
<p class="normal">Five years, with examinations and being sent down to commissioners and
all that. Well, now I am back again. I drink home-brewed beer; I
patronize local tailors; I have even, with a noble fearlessness of
death, eaten the deer-steak of the season; and this I call pleasure!
Yes, youth, travel, and women are good things; but the world must be
ruled, and sober men are needed. Your time will come some day. The
years of honor are approaching. Yes, yes, especially when one joins the
ecclesiastical courts.</p>
<br>
<h3>MAX.</h3>
<p class="normal">Are you going to do that?</p>
<br>
<h3>VON KELLER.</h3>
<p class="normal">I think of it. And to be at one with those of the cloth-- I speak quite
openly with you--it is worth my while, in short, to interest myself in
religious questions. I have of late in my speeches, as perhaps you
know, taken this position; and as for the connections which this
household has--let me tell you I am proud of them.</p>
<br>
<h3>MAX.</h3>
<p class="normal">You might have been proud long ago.</p>
<br>
<h3>VON KELLER.</h3>
<p class="normal">Excuse me, am I over-sensitive? Or do I read a reproach in your words?</p>
<br>
<h3>MAX.</h3>
<p class="normal">Not quite that, but--if you will pardon me, it has sometimes
appeared--and not to me alone--as if you avoided the houses where my
uncle's family were to be found.</p>
<br>
<h3>VON KELLER.</h3>
<p class="normal">And my presence here now--does not that prove the contrary?</p>
<br>
<h3>MAX.</h3>
<p class="normal">Exactly. And therefore I too will speak very frankly. You were the last
person to meet my lost cousin, Magda.</p>
<br>
<h3>VON KELLER.</h3>
<p class="normal">[<i>Confused</i>.] Who says--</p>
<br>
<h3>MAX.</h3>
<p class="normal">You yourself have spoken of it, I am told. You met her with my friend
Heydebrand when he was at the military academy.</p>
<br>
<h3>VON KELLER.</h3>
<p class="normal">Yes, yes, it's true.</p>
<br>
<h3>MAX.</h3>
<p class="normal">It was wrong of me not to ask you about her openly, but you will
probably understand my reticence. I feel almost as if I belonged to
this family and I feared to learn something which might disgrace it.</p>
<br>
<h3>VON KELLER.</h3>
<p class="normal">Oh, not at all, not in the least. It was like this. When I was in
Berlin for the State Examinations, I saw one day on Leipsic Street a
familiar face,--a home face, if I may say so. You know what that is
when one is far away. Well, we spoke to each other. I learned that she
was studying to sing in opera, and that for this purpose she had left
her home.</p>
<br>
<h3>MAX.</h3>
<p class="normal">Not exactly. She left home to be companion to an old lady.
[<i>Hesitates</i>.] There was a difference with her father.</p>
<br>
<h3>VON KELLER.</h3>
<p class="normal">A love affair?</p>
<br>
<h3>MAX.</h3>
<p class="normal">In a way. Her father supported the suitor and told her to obey or leave
his house.</p>
<br>
<h3>VON KELLER.</h3>
<p class="normal">And she went away?</p>
<br>
<h3>MAX.</h3>
<p class="normal">Yes. Then, a year later, when she wrote that she was going on the
stage, it made the breach complete. But what else did you hear?</p>
<br>
<h3>VON KELLER.</h3>
<p class="normal">That's all.</p>
<br>
<h3>MAX.</h3>
<p class="normal">Nothing else?</p>

<h3>VON KELLER.</h3>
<p class="normal">Well, well,--I met her once or twice at the opera-house where she had a
pass.</p>
<br>
<h3>MAX.</h3>
<p class="normal">And you know absolutely nothing of her life?</p>
<br>
<h3>VON KELLER.</h3>
<p class="normal">[<i>With a shrug</i>.] Have you heard nothing from her?</p>
<br>
<h3>MAX.</h3>
<p class="normal">Nothing at all. Well, at any rate, I am grateful to you. I beg you,
however, not to mention the meeting to my uncle, unless he asks you
about it directly. He knows of it, of course, but the name of the lost
daughter is never mentioned in this house.</p>
<br>
<h3>VON KELLER.</h3>
<p class="normal">Oh, I have tact enough not to do that.</p>
<br>
<h3>MAX.</h3>
<p class="normal">And what do you think has become of her?</p>
<br>
<h3>VON KELLER.</h3>
<p class="normal">Oh, music is a lottery. Ten thousand blanks and one prize. A host of
beginners and but one who makes a career. If one becomes a Patti or a
Sembrich, or, to come down to our own Festival--</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><i>Enter </i><span class="sc">Schwartze </span><i>and </i><span class="sc">Mrs. Schwartze</span>.</p>
<br>
<h3>SCHWARTZE.</h3>
<p class="normal">[<i>Shaking hands</i>.] Welcome to my house! Councillor von Keller, my wife.</p>
<br>
<h3>MRS. SCHWARTZE.</h3>
<p class="normal">Pray sit down.</p>
<br>
<h3>VON KELLER.</h3>
<p class="normal">I should not have dared, madam, to ask the honor of this introduction
had I not wished so strongly to share in the good and useful work which
centres here. My purpose may excuse my temerity.</p>
<br>
<h3>SCHWARTZE.</h3>
<p class="normal">You're very kind; but you do us too much honor. If you seek the centre
of the whole movement, Pastor Heffterdingt is the man. He inspires all;
he controls all; he--</p>
<br>
<h3>MRS. SCHWARTZE.</h3>
<p class="normal">Do you know our pastor, sir?</p>
<br>
<h3>VON KELLER.</h3>
<p class="normal">I have heard him speak many times, dear lady, and have admired equally
the sincerity of his convictions and his naïve faith in human nature.
But I cannot comprehend the influence he exerts.</p>
<br>
<h3>MRS. SCHWARTZE.</h3>
<p class="normal">You will find it out. He is so plain and simple that one hardly
realizes what a man he is. He brings every one round.</p>
<br>
<h3>VON KELLER.</h3>
<p class="normal">I am almost converted already, dear lady.</p>
<br>
<h3>SCHWARTZE.</h3>
<p class="normal">As for us here, all I can do is to give these weak and useless hands to
help on the great work. It's only right that an old soldier should
dedicate the little strength left him by the throne to the service of
the altar. Those are the two causes to fight for.</p>
<br>
<h3>VON KELLER.</h3>
<p class="normal">That's a great thought!</p>
<br>
<h3>SCHWARTZE.</h3>
<p class="normal">Thanks, thanks, but no more of this. Ah, ten years ago, when they gave
me my discharge, I was a devil of a fellow. Max, doesn't my old
battalion still tremble at my name?</p>
<br>
<h3>MAX.</h3>
<p class="normal">That they do, uncle.</p>
<br>
<h3>SCHWARTZE.</h3>
<p class="normal">Ah, that is one thing you escape in the civil service,--being laid on
the shelf without any fault of your own,--without the shadow of a
fault. Then there came a slight stroke of apoplexy. See how my hand
trembles now! And what had I to look forward to? It was then that my
young friend, Heffterdingt, showed me the way, through work and prayer,
to a new youth. Without him I never should have found it.</p>
<br>
<h3>MRS. SCHWARTZE.</h3>
<p class="normal">You mustn't believe all he says, Mr. von Keller. If he didn't always
depreciate himself, he would be better thought of in the highest
circles.</p>
<br>
<h3>VON KELLER.</h3>
<p class="normal">High and low, madam, everywhere your husband is known and honored.</p>
<br>
<h3>SCHWARTZE.</h3>
<p class="normal">[<i>Lighting up</i>.] Indeed? Ah, well, no vanity. No, no, that is the moth
that corrupts.</p>
<br>
<h3>MRS. SCHWARTZE.</h3>
<p class="normal">Is it really so wrong to wish for a little honor?</p>
<br>
<h3>VON KELLER.</h3>
<p class="normal">Oh!</p>
<br>
<h3>SCHWARTZE.</h3>
<p class="normal">What is honor? You would call it being led up the room by the governor,
or being asked to tea at the castle when the royal family is here.</p>
<br>
<h3>MRS. SCHWARTZE.</h3>
<p class="normal">You know very well that the latter honor has never fallen to my lot.</p>
<br>
<h3>SCHWARTZE.</h3>
<p class="normal">Oh, yes, pardon me. I knew your weak spot. I should have avoided it.</p>
<br>
<h3>MRS. SCHWARTZE.</h3>
<p class="normal">Yes, just think, Councillor, Mrs. Fanny Hirschfeld of the Children's
Hospital was invited, and I was not.</p>
<br>
<h3>VON KELLER.</h3>
<p class="normal">[<i>Deprecatingly</i>.] Oh!</p>
<br>
<h3>SCHWARTZE.</h3>
<p class="normal">[<i>Laughing, and stroking her head</i>.] Ah, the moth that corrupts, the
moth that corrupts! [<i>Enter </i><span class="sc">Marie </span><i>with the coffee. She bows in a
friendly way to </i><span class="sc">Von Keller</span>.] Herr von Keller, my daughter--my only
daughter.</p>
<br>
<h3>VON KELLER.</h3>
<p class="normal">I've already had the pleasure.</p>
<br>
<h3>MARIE.</h3>
<p class="normal">I can't offer you a hand for welcome, Dr. Von Keller, but you may have
a cup of coffee instead.</p>
<br>
<h3>VON KELLER.</h3>
<p class="normal">[<i>Helping himself and looking at the others</i>.] I am very fortunate in
being treated like an old acquaintance of the family.</p>
<br>
<h3>SCHWARTZE.</h3>
<p class="normal">As far as we are concerned, you shall become not only an acquaintance
but a friend. And that is no conventional politeness, Councillor; for I
know you, and in these times, when all the ties of morality and
authority seem strained to bursting, it is doubly necessary that those
who stand for the good old patriarchal order should hold together.</p>
<br>
<h3>VON KELLER.</h3>
<p class="normal">Very true, very true indeed. One doesn't hear such sentiments as that
in the world in general, where modern ideas pass current for small
change.</p>
<br>
<h3>SCHWARTZE.</h3>
<p class="normal">Modern ideas! Oh, pshaw! I know them. But come into the quiet homes
where are bred brave soldiers and virtuous wives. There you'll hear no
talk about heredity, no arguments about individuality, no scandalous
gossip. There modern ideas have no foothold, for it is there that the
life and strength of the Fatherland abide. Look at this home! There is
no luxury,--hardly even what you call good taste,--faded rugs, birchen
chairs, old pictures; and yet when you see the beams of the western sun
pour through the white curtains and lie with such a loving touch on the
old room, does not something say to you, &quot;Here dwells true happiness&quot;?
[<span class="sc">Von Keller </span><i>nods with conviction</i>.]</p>
<br>
<h3>SCHWARTZE.</h3>
<p class="normal">[<i>Broodingly</i>.] And here it might have dwelt!</p>
<br>
<h3>MARIE.</h3>
<p class="normal">[<i>Hurrying to him</i>.] Papa!</p>
<br>
<h3>SCHWARTZE.</h3>
<p class="normal">Yes, yes, I know. Well, in this house rules old-fashioned paternal
authority. And it shall rule as long as I live. And am I therefore a
tyrant? Tell me. You ought to know.</p>
<br>
<h3>MARIE.</h3>
<p class="normal">You're the best, the dearest--</p>
<br>
<h3>MRS. SCHWARTZE.</h3>
<p class="normal">He is so excitable, you see, Councillor.</p>
<br>
<h3>SCHWARTZE.</h3>
<p class="normal">Have you not been well brought up? And shall we not hold together, we
three? But the age goes on planting rebellion in children's hearts,
putting mistrust between man and wife [<i>rises</i>], and it will never be
satisfied till the last roof-tree smokes in ruins, and men wander about
the streets, fearful and alone, like homeless curs. [<i>Sinks back

<br>
<h3>MRS. SCHWARTZE.</h3>
<p class="normal">You ought not to get so wrought up, papa. You know it is bad for you.
[<span class="sc">Max </span><i>makes a sign to </i><span class="sc">Von Keller</span>.]</p>
<br>
<h3>VON KELLER.</h3>
<p class="normal">Shall I go? [<span class="sc">Max </span><i>nods</i>.] This is an interesting subject to develop,
Colonel. I must say I think perhaps you are a little severe. But my
time--</p>
<br>
<h3>SCHWARTZE.</h3>
<p class="normal">Severe? Ah, well, don't think ill of an old man for speaking a little
too hotly.</p>
<br>

<p class="normal">Ah, sir, heat is the badge of youth. I believe I am a graybeard beside
you.</p>

<p class="normal">The gentlemen of the card-club will be here soon. How lucky that we
didn't eat the haunch of venison Sunday! I've ordered some red wine for
the General, too. I paid three marks; that's not too dear, is it?</p>
<br>
<h3>SCHWARTZE.</h3>
<p class="normal">Not if it's good. Is your sister coming to-day?</p>
<br>
<h3>MRS. SCHWARTZE.</h3>
<p class="normal">I think so.</p>

<h3>SCHWARTZE.</h3>
<p class="normal">She was asked to the Governor's yesterday, wasn't she?</p>
<br>
<h3>MRS. SCHWARTZE.</h3>
<p class="normal">[<i>Sighing</i>.] Yes.</p>
<br>

<p class="normal">And we were not. Poor thing! She must look out for me to-day if she

<p class="normal">Here they are.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="sc">Major-general Von Klebs</span>, <span class="sc">Professor

<br>

<p class="normal">My humblest respects to the ladies. Ah, my dear madam! [<i>Kisses her
hand</i>.]</p>
<br>
<h3>MRS. SCHWARTZE.</h3>
<p class="normal">Make yourselves at home, gentlemen.</p>
<br>
<h3>VON KLEBS.</h3>
<p class="normal">Ha, my dear Colonel, hearty as ever? All ready for the fray, little
one? Now we are all right. But we were almost too late. We were caught
in the Music Festival crowd. Such a confusion! I was bringing the
schoolmaster along, and just as we passed by the German House, there
was a great crush of people, gaping as if there were a princess at the
least. And what do you suppose it was? A singer! These are really what
one may call goings-on. All this fuss about a singer! What do they call
the person?</p>
<br>
<h3>BECKMANN.</h3>
<p class="normal">Ah, General, we seem to be in a strange land to-day.</p>
<br>
<h3>VON KLEBS.</h3>
<p class="normal">We are under a curse, my dear madam. We are bearing a penance. [<i>They
sit</i>.]</p>
<br>
<h3>BECKMANN.</h3>
<p class="normal">But you must know dall' Orto, the great Italian Wagner singer. We are
very fortunate in getting her for the festival. If she were not here--</p>
<br>
<h3>VON KLEBS.</h3>
<p class="normal">Well, well, what if she were not? Eh? I hoped that our strictly moral
circle, at least, would hold itself aloof from all this. But since the
Governor gives receptions in the lady's honor! And, best of all, to cap
the climax, who do you think was standing to-day among the enthusiasts,
craning his neck like the rest? You'll never guess. It's too
inconceivable. The pastor!</p>
<br>
<h3>SCHWARTZE.</h3>
<p class="normal">The pastor?</p>
<br>
<h3>VON KLEBS.</h3>
<p class="normal">Yes, our pastor.</p>
<br>
<h3>SCHWARTZE.</h3>
<p class="normal">How extraordinary!</p>
<br>
<h3>VON KLEBS.</h3>
<p class="normal">Now, I ask you, what did he want there? And what did the others want
there? And what good is the whole festival?</p>
<br>
<h3>BECKMANN.</h3>
<p class="normal">I should think that the cultivation of the faculty of the ideal among
the people was an object--</p>
<br>
<h3>VON KLEBS.</h3>
<p class="normal">The way to cultivate the faculty of the ideal is to found a Soldiers'
Union.</p>
<br>
<h3>SCHWARTZE.</h3>
<p class="normal">But, General, every one isn't so lucky as to be a soldier.</p>
<br>
<h3>VON KLEBS.</h3>
<p class="normal">[<i>Sorting his cards</i>.] Well, we have been, Colonel. I know no one, I
wish to know no one, who has not been a soldier. And all this so-called
Art,--what good does it do?</p>
<br>
<h3>BECKMANN.</h3>
<p class="normal">Art raises the moral tone of the people.</p>
<br>
<h3>VON KLEBS.</h3>
<p class="normal">There we have it, madam!--We're beaten, beaten by the hero of
Königgrätz.--I tell you Art is a mere invention of those who are afraid
to be soldiers to gain an important position for themselves. I pass.</p>
<br>
<h3>SCHWARTZE.</h3>
<p class="normal">I pass.</p>

<h3>BECKMANN.</h3>

<p class="normal">With dark hair, and very proud and tall--and around her a crowd of men
just like the circle about royalty--and chatting and laughing. And any
one to whom she spoke seemed as happy as if it were the Princess. And
she wore half a dozen orders, and an orange band with a medal about her
neck. I was wondering what royal personage it could be--when she turned
half around--and--I knew Magda's eyes!</p>

<br>

<br>
<h3>MRS. SCHWARTZE.</h3>

<h3>HEFFTERDINGT.</h3>
<p class="normal">Is that your fixed resolve?</p>

<h3>FRANZISKA.</h3>
<p class="normal">What sort of a heart have you? You ought to imitate me. She offended me
as only she could,--the little wretch! That is, then she was a little
wretch. But now--well, she did not look at me; but if she had--</p>

<p class="normal">Leopold, she was on his Excellency's arm!</p>
<br>
<h3>SCHWARTZE.</h3>
<p class="normal">I tell you, and you,--and you, too, Pastor,--that I would rather have
seen her lying in rags and tatters at my feet and begging for
forgiveness. For then I should have known that she was still, at heart,
my child. But why has she come back here? The world was large enough
for her triumph. Why should she rob this humble provincial nest of
ours? I know why. To show her miserable father how far one can rise in
the world by treading filial duty into the dust,--that is her
intention. Pride and arrogance speak in her, and nothing else.</p>
<br>
<h3>HEFFTERDINGT.</h3>
<p class="normal">My dear Colonel, I might ask, what speaks in you? A father's love? You
could make no pretence to that. Your rights? I think rather it would be
your right to rejoice in the good fortune of your child. Offended
custom? I don't know-- Your daughter has done so much through her own
strength that even offended custom might at least condone it. It
appears to me that pride and arrogance speak in you--and nothing else.</p>
<br>
<h3>SCHWARTZE.</h3>
<p class="normal">[<i>Angrily</i>.] Pastor!</p>
<br>
<h3>HEFFTERDINGT.</h3>
<p class="normal">Oh, don't be angry--there is no need of that. When I have something to
say, I must say it, mustn't I? I might almost think that it displeased
you that she has climbed so high in spite of you. Your pride demands
something to forgive, and you are angry because there is nothing to be
forgiven. And now, let me ask you, do you seriously wish that she had
found her way home, lost and ruined? Do you dare answer for such a wish
before the throne of God? [<i>A silence</i>.] No, my dear old friend. You
have often, in jest, called me your good angel; let me be so once, in

<h3>MAGDA.</h3>
<p class="normal">[<i>Sits down and examines him through her lorgnette</i>.] So this is the
man who undertakes by a five minutes' interview entirely and absolutely
to break my will. That they believe in your ability to do it shows me
that you are a king in your own dominions. I make obeisance. And now
let me see you ply your arts.</p>
<br>
<h3>HEFFTERDINGT.</h3>
<p class="normal">I understand no arts, madam, and would avail myself of none. If they
put some trust in me here, it is because they know that I seek nothing
for myself.</p>
<br>
<h3>MAGDA.</h3>
<p class="normal">[<i>Ironically</i>.] That has always been the case?</p>
<br>
<h3>HEFFTERDINGT.</h3>
<p class="normal">No, madam. I had, once in my life, a strong, an intense desire. It was
to have you for my wife. I need only look at you to see that I was
presumptuous. Since then I have put the wish away from me.</p>
<br>
<h3>MAGDA.</h3>
<p class="normal">Ah, Pastor, I believe you're paying court to me now.</p>
<br>
<h3>HEFFTERDINGT.</h3>
<p class="normal">Madam, if it were not discourteous--</p>
<br>
<h3>MAGDA.</h3>
<p class="normal">Oh, then even a shepherd of souls may be discourteous!</p>
<br>
<h3>HEFFTERDINGT.</h3>
<p class="normal">I should commiserate you on the atmosphere which has surrounded you.</p>
<br>
<h3>MAGDA.</h3>
<p class="normal">[<i>With mocking superiority</i>.] Really? What do you know about my
atmosphere?</p>
<br>
<h3>HEFFTERDINGT.</h3>
<p class="normal">It seems to me that it has made you forget that serious men are to be
taken seriously.</p>
<br>
<h3>MAGDA.</h3>
<p class="normal">Ah! [<i>Rising</i>.] Well, then I will take you seriously; and I will tell
you that you have always been unbearable to me, with your well-acted
simplicity, your droning mildness, your-- Since, however, you
condescended to cast your eyes on my worthlessness and drove me from
home with your suit,--since then, I have hated you.</p>
<br>
<h3>HEFFTERDINGT.</h3>
<p class="normal">It seems to me that according to this I was the foundation of your
greatness.</p>
<br>
<h3>MAGDA.</h3>
<p class="normal">You're right there. Here I was parched and stifled. No, no, I don't
hate you. Why should I hate you so much? It's all so far, so very far,
behind me. If you only knew how far! You have sat here day after day in
this heavy close air, reeking of lavender, tobacco, and cough mixture,
while I have felt the storm breaking about my head. Pastor, if you had
a suspicion of what life really is,--of the trial of strength, of the
taste of guilt, of conquest, and of pleasure,--you would find yourself
very comical with your clerical shop-talk. Ha, ha, ha! Pardon me, I
don't believe such a laugh has rung through this respectable house for
twelve years; for there's no one here who knows how to laugh. Is there,
eh?</p>
<br>
<h3>HEFFTERDINGT.</h3>
<p class="normal">No, I fear not.</p>
<br>
<h3>MAGDA.</h3>
<p class="normal">Fear, you say. That sounds as though you deprecated it. But don't you
hate laughter?</p>
<br>
<h3>HEFFTERDINGT.</h3>
<p class="normal">Most of us cannot laugh, madam.</p>
<br>
<h3>MAGDA.</h3>
<p class="normal">And to those who could, laughter is sin. You might laugh yourself. What
have you to be solemn about? You need not look at the world with this
funereal mien. Surely you have a little blond wife at home who knits
industriously, and half a dozen curly heads around her, of course. It's
always so in parsonages.</p>
<br>
<h3>HEFFTERDINGT.</h3>
<p class="normal">I have remained single, madam.</p>
<br>
<h3>MAGDA.</h3>
<p class="normal">Ah! [<i>Silence</i>.] Did I hurt you so much, then?</p>
<br>
<h3>HEFFTERDINGT.</h3>
<p class="normal">Let that be, shall we not? It is so long ago.</p>
<br>
<h3>MAGDA.</h3>
<p class="normal">[<i>Letting her mantle fall</i>.] And your work,--does not that bring
happiness enough?</p>
<br>
<h3>HEFFTERDINGT.</h3>
<p class="normal">Thank God, it does. But if one takes it really in earnest, one cannot
live only for one's self; at least, I cannot. One cannot exult in the
fulness of one's personality, as you would call it. And then many
hearts are opened to me-- One sees too many wounds there, that one
cannot heal, to be quite happy.</p>
<br>
<h3>MAGDA.</h3>
<p class="normal">You're a remarkable man-- I don't know--if I could only get rid of the
idea that you're insincere.</p>
<br>
<h3>HEFFTERDINGT.</h3>
<p class="normal">Will you let me ask you one question before you go?</p>
<br>
<h3>MAGDA.</h3>
<p class="normal">Well!</p>
<br>
<h3>HEFFTERDINGT.</h3>
<p class="normal">It is about an hour since you entered this house, your home--no, not so
much. I could not have been waiting for you nearly as long as that.</p>
<br>
<h3>MAGDA.</h3>
<p class="normal">For me? You? Where?</p>
<br>
<h3>HEFFTERDINGT.</h3>
<p class="normal">In the corridor outside your room.</p>
<br>
<h3>MAGDA.</h3>
<p class="normal">What did you want there?</p>
<br>
<h3>HEFFTERDINGT.</h3>
<p class="normal">My errand was useless, for now you are here.</p>
<br>
<h3>MAGDA.</h3>
<p class="normal">Do you mean to say that you came for me--you to whom I-- If any one had
an interest in keeping me away, it was you.</p>
<br>
<h3>HEFFTERDINGT.</h3>
<p class="normal">Are you accustomed to regard everything which those about you do as the
result of selfish interest?</p>
<br>
<h3>MAGDA.</h3>
<p class="normal">Of course. It's so with me! [<i>Struck by a new thought</i>.] Or perhaps
you-- No, I'm not justified in that assumption. [<i>Sharply</i>.] Ah, such
nonsense! it is only fit for fairy tales. Well, Pastor, I'll own that I
like you now better, much better than of old when you--what shall I
say?--made an honorable proposal.</p>
<br>
<h3>HEFFTERDINGT.</h3>
<p class="normal">H'm!</p>
<br>
<h3>MAGDA.</h3>
<p class="normal">If you could only end it all with a laugh--this stony visage of yours
is so unfriendly--one is quite <i>sconcertata</i>. What do you say? <i>Je ne
trouve pas le mot</i>.</p>
<br>
<h3>HEFFTERDINGT.</h3>
<p class="normal">Pardon me, may I ask the question now?</p>
<br>
<h3>MAGDA.</h3>
<p class="normal">Good Lord, how inquisitive the holy man is! And you don't see
that I was coquetting with you a little. For, to have been a man's
fate,--that flatters us women,--we are grateful for it. You see I have
acquired some art meanwhile. Well, out with your question!</p>
<br>
<h3>HEFFTERDINGT.</h3>
<p class="normal">Why--why did you come home?</p>
<br>
<h3>MAGDA.</h3>
<p class="normal">Ah!</p>
<br>
<h3>HEFFTERDINGT.</h3>
<p class="normal">Was it not homesickness?</p>
<br>
<h3>MAGDA.</h3>
<p class="normal">No. Well, perhaps a very little. I'll tell you. When I received the
invitation to assist at this festival--why they did me the honor, I
don't know--a very curious feeling began to seethe within me,--half
curiosity and half shyness, half melancholy and half defiance,--which
said: &quot;Go home incognito. Go in the twilight and stand before the
paternal house where for seventeen years you lived in bondage. There
look upon what you were. But if they recognize you, show them that
beyond their narrow virtues there may be something true and good.&quot;</p>
<br>
<h3>HEFFTERDINGT.</h3>
<p class="normal">Only defiance then?</p>
<br>
<h3>MAGDA.</h3>
<p class="normal">At first, perhaps. Once on the way, though, my heart beat most
wonderfully, as it used to do when I'd learnt my lesson badly. And I
always did learn my lessons badly. When I stood before the hotel, the
German House,--just think, the German House, where the great officials
and the great artists stayed,--there I had again the abject reverence
as of old, as if I were unworthy to step on the old threshold. I
entirely forgot that I was now myself a so-called great artist. Since
then, every evening I have stolen by the house,--very quietly, very
humbly,--always almost in tears.</p>
<br>
<h3>HEFFTERDINGT.</h3>
<p class="normal">And nevertheless you are going away.</p>
<br>
<h3>MAGDA.</h3>
<p class="normal">I must.</p>
<br>
<h3>HEFFTERDINGT.</h3>
<p class="normal">But--</p>
<br>
<h3>MAGDA.</h3>
<p class="normal">Don't ask me why. I must.</p>
<br>
<h3>HEFFTERDINGT.</h3>
<p class="normal">Has any one offended your pride? Has any one said a word of your
needing forgiveness?</p>
<br>
<h3>MAGDA.</h3>
<p class="normal">Not yet--or, yes, if you count the old cat.</p>
<br>
<h3>HEFFTERDINGT.</h3>
<p class="normal">What is there in the world which draws you away again after an hour?</p>
<br>
<h3>MAGDA.</h3>
<p class="normal">I will tell you. I felt it the first minute I came. The paternal
authority already stretches its net over me again, and the yoke stands
ready beneath which I must bow.</p>
<br>
<h3>HEFFTERDINGT.</h3>
<p class="normal">But there is neither yoke nor net here. Do not fear shadows. Here are
only wide-opened arms which wait to clasp the lost daughter to the
empty breast.</p>
<br>
<h3>MAGDA.</h3>
<p class="normal">Oh, I beg you, none of that. I do not intend to furnish a pendant to
the prodigal son. If I came back as a daughter, as a lost daughter, I
should not hold my head up before you as I do; I should grovel in the
dust in full consciousness of all my sins. [<i> With growing
excitement</i>.] And that I will not do--that I cannot do--for I am
what I am, and I cannot be another. [<i>Sadly</i>.] And therefore I have no
home--therefore I must go forth again--therefore--</p>

<h3>MRS. SCHWARTZE.</h3>
<p class="normal">Excuse me, Pastor, I only wanted to know about supper. [<i>Imploringly

happen to have a warm joint to-day. You know, Pastor, the gentlemen of

<p class="normal">[<i>Appearing in the doorway</i>.] Will she stay? [<span class="sc">Magda </span><i>shrinks at the

<h3>MRS. SCHWARTZE.</h3>
<p class="normal">'Sh! [<i>Exit </i><span class="sc">Mrs. Schwartze </span><i>and </i><span class="sc">Marie</span>.</p>
<br>
<h3>HEFFTERDINGT.</h3>
<p class="normal">You have no home, Miss Magda? Did you hear the old mother beseeching
and alluring with the best that she has, though it's only a poor dish?
Did you hear Marie's voice trembling with tears in the fear that I
should not prevail? They trust me too much; they think I only need to
speak the word. They don't suspect how helpless I stand here before
you. Look! Behind that door are three people in a fever of sorrow and
love. If you cross this threshold, you rob each of them of so much
life. And you have no home?</p>
<br>
<h3>MAGDA.</h3>
<p class="normal">If I have one, it is not here.</p>
<br>
<h3>HEFFTERDINGT.</h3>
<p class="normal">[<i>Embarrassed</i>.] Perhaps-- Nevertheless you should not go. Only a few
days,--just not to take away the idea that you belong here. So much you
owe to them!</p>
<br>
<h3>MAGDA.</h3>
<p class="normal">[<i>Sadly</i>.] I owe nothing now to any one here.</p>
<br>
<h3>HEFFTERDINGT.</h3>
<p class="normal">No? Really nothing? Then I must tell you about a certain day,--eleven
years ago now. I was called into this house in haste, for the Colonel
was dying. When I came, he lay there stiff and motionless, his face
drawn and white; one eye was already closed, in the other still
flickered a little life. He tried to speak, but his lips only quivered
and mumbled.</p>
<br>
<h3>MAGDA.</h3>
<p class="normal">What had happened?</p>
<br>
<h3>HEFFTERDINGT.</h3>
<p class="normal">What had happened? I will tell you. He had just received a letter in
which his eldest daughter bade him farewell.</p>
<br>
<h3>MAGDA.</h3>
<p class="normal">My God!</p>
<br>
<h3>HEFFTERDINGT.</h3>
<p class="normal">It was a long time before he recovered from the apoplectic stroke. Only
a trembling in the right arm, which you perhaps have noticed, now
remains.</p>
<br>
<h3>MAGDA.</h3>
<p class="normal">That is indeed a debt I owe.</p>
<br>
<h3>HEFFTERDINGT.</h3>
<p class="normal">Ah, if that were all, Miss Magda! Pardon me, I call you by the name I
used long ago. It springs to my lips.</p>
<br>
<h3>MAGDA.</h3>
<p class="normal">Call me what you like. Go on.</p>
<br>
<h3>HEFFTERDINGT.</h3>
<p class="normal">The necessary result followed. When he received his discharge,--he will
not believe in the cause, don't speak to him of it,--then his mind
broke down.</p>
<br>
<h3>MAGDA.</h3>
<p class="normal">Yes, yes; that is my debt too.</p>
<br>
<h3>HEFFTERDINGT.</h3>
<p class="normal">Then you see, Miss Magda, began my work. If I speak of it, you must not
think I am pluming myself on it to you. What good would that do me? For
a long, long time I nursed him, and by degrees I saw his mind revive
again. First I let him collect slugs from the rose-bushes.</p>
<br>
<h3>MAGDA.</h3>
<p class="normal">[<i> With a shudder</i>.] Ugh!</p>
<br>
<h3>HEFFTERDINGT.</h3>
<p class="normal">Yes, so far had it gone; then I gave him charge of some money, and then
I made him my assistant in the institutions with whose management I was
intrusted. There is a hospital and a soup-kitchen and an infirmary, and
it makes a great deal to be done. So he became a man once more. I have
tried to influence your step-mother too; not because I was greedy for
power. Perhaps you'll think that of me. In short, the old tension
between her and Marie has been slowly smoothed away. Love and
confidence have descended upon the house.</p>
<br>
<h3>MAGDA.</h3>
<p class="normal">[<i>Staring at him</i>.] And why did you do all this?</p>
<br>
<h3>HEFFTERDINGT.</h3>
<p class="normal">Well, first it is my calling. Then I did it for his sake, for I love
the old man; and above all--for--your sake.</p>

<p class="hang2">[<span class="sc">Magda </span><i>starts, and points to herself interrogatively</i>.]</p>
<br>
<h3>HEFFTERDINGT.</h3>
<p class="normal">Yes, for your sake. For this weighed upon me: The day will come when
she will turn homeward,--perhaps as victor; but perhaps also as
vanquished, broken and ruined in body and soul-- Pardon me these
thoughts, I had heard nothing of you-- In either case she shall find a
home ready for her. That was my work, the work of long years; and now I
implore you not to destroy it.</p>
<br>
<h3>MAGDA.</h3>
<p class="normal">[<i>In anguish</i>.] If you knew through what I have passed, you would not
try to keep me.</p>
<br>
<h3>HEFFTERDINGT.</h3>
<p class="normal">That is all shut out. This is home. Let it alone; forget it.</p>
<br>
<h3>MAGDA.</h3>
<p class="normal">How can I forget it? How dare I?</p>
<br>
<h3>HEFFTERDINGT.</h3>
<p class="normal">Why should you resist when all stretch their hands out to you in
rejoicing? It's very easy. Let your heart speak when you see all around

<h3>MAGDA.</h3>
<p class="normal">No, my friend, I don't regret it. But I feel very curiously. I seem to
be in a tepid bath, I'm so weak and warm. What they call German
sentiment is awaking again, and I have been so unused to it. My heart
seems like a Christmas number of the &quot;Gartenlaube,&quot;--moonlight,
betrothals, lieutenants, and I don't know what! But the best of it is,
I know that I'm playing with myself. I can cast it all off as a child

<h3>HEFFTERDINGT.</h3>
<p class="normal">I don't think one should be terrified at feeling filial love.</p>
<br>
<h3>MAGDA.</h3>
<p class="normal">Filial love? I should like to take that snow-white head in my lap and
say, &quot;You old child!&quot; And nevertheless I must bend my will, I must bend
my will. I am not accustomed to that. I must conquer; I must sing down
opposition. I sing or I live,--for both are one and the same,--so that
men must will as I do. I force them, I compel them to love and mourn
and exult and lament as I do. And woe to him who resists! I sing them
down,--I sing and sing until they become slaves and playthings in my
hands. I know I'm confused, but you understand what I mean.</p>
<br>
<h3>HEFFTERDINGT.</h3>

isn't it?</p>
<br>
<h3>MAGDA.</h3>
<p class="normal"><i>Si, si, si, si</i>! Oh, I could tell you everything. Your heart has
tendrils which twine about other hearts and draw them out. And you
don't do it selfishly. You don't know how mighty you are. The men
outside there are beasts, whether in love or hate. But you are a man.
And one feels like a man when one is near you. Just think, when you
came in yesterday, you seemed to me so small; but something grows out
from you and becomes always greater, almost too great for me.</p>
<br>
<h3>HEFFTERDINGT.</h3>
<p class="normal">Good Heavens, what can it be?</p>
<br>
<h3>MAGDA.</h3>
<p class="normal">What shall I call it,--self-sacrifice, self-abnegation? It is something
with self--or rather the reverse. That is what impresses me. And that
is why you can do so much with me.</p>
<br>
<h3>HEFFTERDINGT.</h3>
<p class="normal">How strange!</p>
<br>
<h3>MAGDA.</h3>
<p class="normal">What?</p>
<br>
<h3>HEFFTERDINGT.</h3>

<h3>MAGDA.</h3>
<p class="normal">Ha, ha! You, model of men! Like me!</p>
<br>
<h3>HEFFTERDINGT.</h3>
<p class="normal">I have had to stifle much in my nature. My peace is the peace of the

<h3>SCHWARTZE.</h3>
<p class="normal">I don't know. You have appeared among us as wonderfully as gloriously.
But brilliance and worldly honor and all that don't blind a father's
eyes. You seem to be warm at heart too. At least, one would think so to
hear you speak. But there is something in your eyes which does not
please me, and a scornful curl about your lips.</p>

<h3>MAGDA.</h3>
<p class="normal">Dear, good old papa!</p>
<br>
<h3>SCHWARTZE.</h3>
<p class="normal">You see! This tenderness is not that of a daughter towards her father.
It is so that one pets a child, whether it be a young or an old one.

<p class="normal">That is good, that is good, my daughter. Believe me, we are not so

that the spirit of moral revolt is abroad in the world. The seed which
should take root in the heart, begins to decay. What were once sins
easily become customs to you. My child, soon you will go away. When you
return, you may find me in the grave.</p>
<br>
<h3>MAGDA.</h3>
<p class="normal">Oh, no, papa!</p>

<p class="normal">[<i>As she opens the door</i>.] My dear, the ladies--</p>
<br>
<h3>MRS. VON KLEBS.</h3>
<p class="normal">[<i>Giving her hand to </i><span class="sc">Mrs. Schwartze</span>.] What a day for you, my dear!
The whole town rejoices in the happy event.</p>
<br>
<h3>MRS. SCHWARTZE.</h3>
<p class="normal">Permit me--my daughter--Mrs. General von Klebs, Mrs. Justice Ellrich,
Mrs. Schumann.</p>
<br>
<h3>MRS. SCHUMANN.</h3>
<p class="normal">I am only the wife of a simple merchant; but--</p>
<br>
<h3>MRS. VON KLEBS.</h3>
<p class="normal">My husband will do himself the honor soon--</p>
<br>
<h3>MRS. SCHWARTZE.</h3>
<p class="normal">Won't you sit down, ladies? [<i>They sit</i>.]</p>
<br>
<h3>FRANZISKA.</h3>
<p class="normal">[<i>With aplomb</i>.] Yes, it is truly a joyful event for the whole family.</p>
<br>
<h3>MRS. VON KLEBS.</h3>
<p class="normal">We have unfortunately not shared the pleasures of the festival, my dear
young lady. I must therefore refrain from expressing that admiration to
which you are so well accustomed.</p>
<br>
<h3>MRS. SCHUMANN.</h3>
<p class="normal">If we had known, we should certainly have ordered tickets.</p>
<br>
<h3>MRS. VON KLEBS.</h3>
<p class="normal">Do you expect to remain here for very long?</p>
<br>
<h3>MAGDA.</h3>
<p class="normal">That I really cannot say, madam--or, pardon me--your ladyship?</p>
<br>
<h3>MRS. VON KLEBS.</h3>
<p class="normal">I must beg you--no.</p>
<br>
<h3>MAGDA.</h3>
<p class="normal">Oh, pardon me!</p>
<br>
<h3>MRS. VON KLEBS.</h3>
<p class="normal">Oh, please!</p>
<br>
<h3>MAGDA.</h3>
<p class="normal">We are such birds of passage, my dear madam, that we can really never
plan for the future.</p>
<br>
<h3>MRS. ELLRICH.</h3>
<p class="normal">But one must have one's real home.</p>
<br>
<h3>MAGDA.</h3>
<p class="normal">Why? One must have a vocation. That seems to me enough.</p>
<br>
<h3>FRANZISKA.</h3>
<p class="normal">It's all in the point of view, dear Magda.</p>
<br>
<h3>MRS. VON KLEBS.</h3>
<p class="normal">Ah, we're so far removed from all these ideas, my dear young lady.
Every now and then some person gives lectures here, but the good
families have nothing to do with it.</p>
<br>
<h3>MAGDA.</h3>
<p class="normal">[<i>Politely</i>.] Oh, I can quite understand that. The good families need
nothing, as they have plenty to eat. [<i>A silence</i>.]</p>
<br>
<h3>MRS. ELLRICH.</h3>
<p class="normal">But at least you must have some residence?</p>
<br>
<h3>MAGDA.</h3>
<p class="normal">If you call it so,--a place to sleep. Yes, I have a villa by the Lake
of Como and an estate at Naples. [<i>Sensation</i>.]</p>
<br>
<h3>MRS. SCHWARTZE.</h3>
<p class="normal">But you've said nothing to us about that.</p>
<br>
<h3>MAGDA.</h3>
<p class="normal">I hardly ever make use of them, mamma dear.</p>
<br>
<h3>MRS. ELLRICH.</h3>
<p class="normal">Art must be a very trying occupation?</p>
<br>
<h3>MAGDA.</h3>
<p class="normal">[<i>In a friendly tone</i>.] It depends upon how one follows it, my dear
madam.</p>
<br>
<h3>MRS. ELLRICH.</h3>
<p class="normal">My daughter used to take singing-lessons, and it always taxed her very
much.</p>
<br>
<h3>MAGDA.</h3>
<p class="normal">[<i>Politely</i>.] Oh, I'm sorry for that.</p>
<br>
<h3>MRS. ELLRICH.</h3>
<p class="normal">Naturally, you only do it for pleasure.</p>
<br>
<h3>MAGDA.</h3>
<p class="normal">Oh, it's so much pleasure! [<i>Aside to </i><span class="sc">Mrs. Schwartze</span>, <i>who sits near
her</i>.] Get these women away, or I shall be rude!</p>
<br>
<h3>MRS. VON KLEBS.</h3>
<p class="normal">Are you really engaged by a theatre, my dear young lady?</p>
<br>
<h3>MAGDA.</h3>
<p class="normal">[<i> Very sweetly</i>.] Sometimes, my dear madam.</p>
<br>
<h3>MRS. VON KLEBS.</h3>
<p class="normal">Then you are out of an engagement at present?</p>
<br>
<h3>MAGDA.</h3>
<p class="normal">[<i>Murmurs</i>.] Oh, come, come! [<i>Aloud</i>.] Yes, I'm a vagabond now. [<i>The

<h3>MRS. VON KLEBS.</h3>
<p class="normal">There are really not many daughters of good families on the stage, are
there?</p>
<br>
<h3>MAGDA.</h3>
<p class="normal">[<i>In a friendly tone</i>.] No, my dear madam; most of them are too stupid.</p>
<br>
<h3>MRS. SCHWARTZE.</h3>
<p class="normal">Oh, Magda!

<i>Enter</i> Max.</p>
<br>
<h3>MAGDA.</h3>
<p class="normal">Oh, that must be Max! [<i>Goes to him and shakes hands</i>.] Just think, I
had quite forgotten your face. We were great friends, were we not?</p>
<br>
<h3>MAX.</h3>
<p class="normal">Were we? [<i>Astonished</i>.]</p>
<br>
<h3>MAGDA.</h3>
<p class="normal">Well, we can begin now.</p>
<br>
<h3>MRS. ELLRICH.</h3>
<p class="normal">[<i>Aside</i>.] Do you understand this?</p>
<br>
<p class="hang1">[<span class="sc">Mrs. Von Klebs </span><i>shrugs her shoulder. The ladies rise and take their

<br>
<h3>MRS. SCHWARTZE.</h3>
<p class="normal">[<i>Confused</i>.] Must you go already, ladies? My husband will be so

<h3>MRS. SCHWARTZE.</h3>
<p class="normal">[<i>Turning back from the door</i>.] Mrs. von Klebs was offended, or she
would have stayed. Magda, you certainly must have offended Mrs. von
Klebs.</p>
<br>
<h3>FRANZISKA.</h3>
<p class="normal">And the other ladies, too, were hurt.</p>
<br>
<h3>MAGDA.</h3>
<p class="normal">Mamma dear, won't you see about my trunk?</p>
<br>
<h3>MRS. SCHWARTZE.</h3>
<p class="normal">Yes, yes, I'll go to the hotel myself. Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear!
[<i>Exit</i>.</p>
<br>
<h3>FRANZISKA.</h3>
<p class="normal">Wait, I'm coming too. [<i>Spitefully</i>.] I must make myself useful, of

<br>
<h3>MAGDA.</h3>
<p class="normal">Oh, Aunt Frankie, a word with you.</p>
<br>
<h3>FRANZISKA.</h3>
<p class="normal">Now?</p>
<br>
<h3>MAGDA.</h3>
<p class="normal">We're going to celebrate a betrothal to-day.</p>
<br>
<h3>FRANZISKA.</h3>
<p class="normal">What betrothal?</p>
<br>
<h3>MAGDA.</h3>
<p class="normal">Between him and Marie.</p>
<br>
<h3>MAX.</h3>
<p class="normal">[<i>Joyfully</i>.] Magda!</p>
<br>
<h3>FRANZISKA.</h3>
<p class="normal">I think, as I occupy a mother's position towards him, that it is my
right--</p>
<br>

<p class="normal">No; the giver alone has rights, my dear aunt. And now don't fail.</p>
<br>
<h3>FRANZISKA.</h3>
<p class="normal">[<i>Furiously</i>.] I will make you-- [<i>Exit</i>.</p>
<br>
<h3>MAX.</h3>
<p class="normal">How shall I thank you, my dear Miss--</p>
<br>
<h3>MAGDA.</h3>
<p class="normal">Magda, my dear cousin, Magda!</p>
<br>
<h3>MAX.</h3>
<p class="normal">Pardon me, it was my great respect--</p>
<br>
<h3>MAGDA.</h3>
<p class="normal">Not so much respect, my boy,--I don't like it; more weight, more
individuality!</p>
<br>
<h3>MAX.</h3>
<p class="normal">Ah, my dear cousin, should a young lieutenant with twenty-five marks'
pay, not to speak of debts, have individuality? It would only be a
hindrance to him.</p>
<br>
<h3>MAGDA.</h3>
<p class="normal">Ah!</p>
<br>
<h3>MAX.</h3>
<p class="normal">If I manage my men properly, and dance a correct figure at our
regimental balls, and am not a coward, that is enough.</p>

<h3>MAGDA.</h3>
<p class="normal">To make a wife happy, certainly. Go and find her. Go along!</p>
<br>
<h3>MAX.</h3>
<p class="normal">[<i>Starts to go, and turns back</i>.] Oh, excuse me, in my happiness I
entirely forgot the message I-- Early this morning--by-the-by, you
can't think what a tumult the whole city is in about you--well, early
this morning--I was still in bed--an acquaintance came in who is also
an old acquaintance of yours, very pale from excitement, and he asked
whether it were all true, and if he might come to see you.</p>
<br>
<h3>MAGDA.</h3>
<p class="normal">Yes, let him come.</p>
<br>
<h3>MAX.</h3>
<p class="normal">He wanted me to ask you first. He would then send in his card this
morning.</p>
<br>
<h3>MAGDA.</h3>
<p class="normal">What formalities the men go through here! Who is he?</p>
<br>
<h3>MAX.</h3>
<p class="normal">Councillor von Keller.</p>
<br>
<h3>MAGDA.</h3>
<p class="normal">[<i>Speaking with difficulty</i>.] He--what?--he?</p>
<br>
<h3>MAX.</h3>
<p class="normal">[<i>Laughing</i>.] Pardon me, but you're as white now as he was.</p>
<br>
<h3>MAGDA.</h3>
<p class="normal">[<i>Quietly</i>.] I? White?

<i>Enter</i> <span class="sc">Theresa </span><i>with a card</i>.</p>
<br>
<h3>MAX.</h3>
<p class="normal">Here he is. Dr. von Keller.</p>
<br>
<h3>MAGDA.</h3>
<p class="normal">Let him come up.</p>
<br>
<h3>MAX.</h3>
<p class="normal">[<i>Smiling</i>.] I'll only say to you, my dear cousin, that he's a very
important man, who has a great career before him, and promises to be a
pillar of our religious circle.</p>
<br>
<h3>MAGDA.</h3>
<p class="normal">Thank you!</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter </i><span class="sc">Von Keller </span><i>with a bouquet</i>.</p>
<br>
<h3>MAX.</h3>
<p class="normal">[<i>Crossing to him</i>.] My dear Councillor, here is my cousin, who is
delighted to see you. You will excuse me.</p>

<p class="right">[<i>Exit, with a bow to each</i>.</p>

<p class="center">[<span class="sc">Von Keller </span><i>remains standing at the door</i>. <span class="sc">Magda </span><i>moves about

<br>
<h3>MAGDA.</h3>
<p class="normal">[<i>Aside</i>.] Here is my spectre! [<i>Indicates a seat at the table, left,
and sits down opposite</i>.]</p>
<br>
<h3>VON KELLER.</h3>
<p class="normal">First, you must allow me to express my warmest and most sincere good
wishes. This is a surprise which you happily could not have expected.
And as a sign of my interest, allow me, my dearest friend, to present
you with these modest flowers.</p>
<br>
<h3>MAGDA.</h3>
<p class="normal">Oh, how thoughtful! [<i>Takes the flowers with a laugh, and throws them
on the table</i>.]</p>
<br>
<h3>VON KELLER.</h3>
<p class="normal">[<i>In embarrassment</i>.] I--I see with sorrow that you resent this
approach on my part. Have I in any way been wanting in the necessary
delicacy? In these narrow circles a meeting could not have been
avoided. I think it is better, my dearest friend, that we should come
to an understanding,--that we should know the relations--</p>
<br>
<h3>MAGDA.</h3>
<p class="normal">[<i>Rising</i>.] You're right, my friend. I was not at the height of my own
nature just now. Had I been, I might have played the deserted
Marguerite to the end. The morals of home had infected me a little. But
I am myself again. Give me your hand bravely. Don't be afraid, I won't
harm you. So--tight--so!</p>
<br>
<h3>VON KELLER.</h3>
<p class="normal">You make me happy.</p>
<br>
<h3>MAGDA.</h3>
<p class="normal">I've painted this meeting to myself a thousand times, and have been
prepared for it for years. Something warned me, too, when I undertook
this journey home--though I must say I hardly expected just here
to-- Yes, how is it that, after what has passed between us, you came
into this house? It seems to me a little--</p>
<br>
<h3>VON KELLER.</h3>
<p class="normal">I tried to avoid it until quite recently; but since we belong to the
same circles, and since I agree with the views of this family--that is,
at least in theory--</p>
<br>
<h3>MAGDA.</h3>
<p class="normal">Yes, yes. Let me look at you, my poor friend. How you have changed!</p>
<br>
<h3>VON KELLER.</h3>
<p class="normal">[<i>Laughing nervously</i>.] I seem to have the misfortune to make a rather
absurd figure in your eyes.</p>
<br>
<h3>MAGDA.</h3>
<p class="normal">No, oh, no! I can see it all. The effort to keep worthy of respect
under such difficulties, with a bad conscience, is awkward. You
look down from the height of your pure atmosphere on your sinful
youth,--for you are called a pillar, my dear friend.</p>
<br>
<h3>VON KELLER.</h3>
<p class="normal">[<i>Looking at the door</i>.] Pardon me--I can hardly accustom myself again
to the affectionate terms. And if any one should hear us-- Would it not
be better--</p>
<br>
<h3>MAGDA.</h3>
<p class="normal">[<i>Sadly</i>.] Let them hear us.</p>
<br>
<h3>VON KELLER.</h3>
<p class="normal">[<i>At the door</i>.] Good Heavens! Well [<i>sitting down again</i>], as I was
saying, if you knew with what real longing I look back from this height
at my gay, discarded youth--</p>
<br>
<h3>MAGDA.</h3>
<p class="normal">[<i>Half to herself</i>.] So gay,-- yes, so gay.</p>
<br>
<h3>VON KELLER.</h3>
<p class="normal">Well, I felt myself called to higher things. I thought-- Why should I
undervalue my position? I have become Councillor, and that
comparatively young. An ordinary ambition might take satisfaction in
that. But one sits and waits at home, while others are called to the
ministry. And this environment, conventionality, and narrowness, all is
so gray,--gray! And the ladies here--for one who cares at all about
elegance--I assure you something rejoiced within me when I read this
morning that you were the famous singer,--you to whom I was tied by so
many dear memories and--</p>
<br>
<h3>MAGDA.</h3>
<p class="normal">And then you thought whether it might not be possible with the help of
these dear memories to bring a little color into the gray background?</p>
<br>
<h3>VON KELLER.</h3>
<p class="normal">[<i>Smiling</i>.] Oh, pray don't--</p>
<br>
<h3>MAGDA.</h3>
<p class="normal">Well, between old friends--</p>
<br>
<h3>VON KELLER.</h3>
<p class="normal">Really, are we that, really?</p>
<br>
<h3>MAGDA.</h3>
<p class="normal">Certainly, <i>sans rancune</i>. Oh, if I took it from the other standpoint,
I should have to range the whole gamut,--liar, coward, traitor! But as
I look at it, I owe you nothing but thanks, my friend.</p>
<br>
<h3>VON KELLER.</h3>
<p class="normal">[<i>Pleased, but confused</i>.] This is a view which--</p>
<br>
<h3>MAGDA.</h3>
<p class="normal">Which is very convenient for you. But why should I not make it
convenient for you? In the manner in which we met, you had no
obligations towards me. I had left my home; I was young and innocent,
hot-blooded and careless, and I lived as I saw others live. I gave
myself to you because I loved you. I might perhaps have loved any one
who came in my way. That--that seemed to be all over. And we were so
happy,--weren't we?</p>
<br>
<h3>VON KELLER.</h3>
<p class="normal">Ah, when I think of it, my heart seems to stop beating.</p>
<br>
<h3>MAGDA.</h3>
<p class="normal">There in the old attic, five flights up, we three girls lived so
merrily in our poverty. Two hired pianos, and in the evening bread and
dripping. Emmy used to warm it herself over the oil-stove.</p>
<br>
<h3>VON KELLER.</h3>
<p class="normal">And Katie with her verses! Good Lord! What has become of them?</p>
<br>
<h3>MAGDA.</h3>
<p class="normal"><i>Chi lo sà</i>? Perhaps they're giving singing-lessons, perhaps they're on
the stage. Yes, we were a merry set; and when the fun had lasted half a
year, one day my lover vanished.</p>
<br>
<h3>VON KELLER.</h3>
<p class="normal">An unlucky chance, I swear to you. My father was ill. I had to travel.
I wrote everything to you.</p>
<br>
<h3>MAGDA.</h3>
<p class="normal">H'm! I did not reproach you. And now I will tell you why I owe you
thanks. I was a stupid, unsuspecting thing, enjoying freedom like a
runaway monkey. Through you I became a woman. For whatever I have done
in my art, for whatever I have become in myself, I have you to thank.
My soul was like--yes, down below there, there used to be an Æolian
harp which was left mouldering because my father could not bear it.
Such a silent harp was my soul; and through you it was given to the
storm. And it sounded almost to breaking,--the whole scale of passions
which bring us women to maturity,--love and hate and revenge and
ambition [<i>springing up</i>], and need, need, need--three times need--and
the highest, the strongest, the holiest of all, the mother's
love!-- All I owe to you!</p>
<br>
<h3>VON KELLER.</h3>
<p class="normal">What--what do you say?</p>
<br>
<h3>MAGDA.</h3>
<p class="normal">Yes, my friend, you have asked after Emmy and Katie. But you haven't
asked after your child.</p>
<br>
<h3>VON KELLER.</h3>
<p class="normal">[<i>Jumping up and looking about anxiously</i>.] My child!</p>
<br>
<h3>MAGDA.</h3>
<p class="normal">Your child? Who calls it so? Yours? Ha, ha! Dare to claim portion
in him and I'll kill you with these hands. Who are you? You're a
strange man who gratified his lust and passed on with a laugh. But I
have a child,--my son, my God, my all! For him I lived and starved
and froze and walked the streets; for him I sang and danced in
concert-halls,--for my child who was crying for his bread! [<i>Breaks out
in a convulsive laugh which changes to weeping, and throws herself on a
seat, right</i>.]</p>
<br>
<h3>VON KELLER.</h3>
<p class="normal">[<i>After a silence</i>.] I am confounded. If I could have suspected,--yes,
if I could have suspected--I will do everything; I will not shrink from
any reparation. But now, I beg you to quiet yourself. They know that I
am here. If they saw us so, I should be--[<i>correcting himself</i>] you
would be lost.</p>
<br>
<h3>MAGDA.</h3>
<p class="normal">Don't be afraid. I won't compromise you.</p>
<br>
<h3>VON KELLER.</h3>
<p class="normal">Oh, I was not speaking for myself, not at all. But just think, if it
were to come out, what the town and your father--</p>
<br>
<h3>MAGDA.</h3>
<p class="normal">Poor old man! His peace is destroyed, at any rate.</p>
<br>
<h3>VON KELLER.</h3>
<p class="normal">And think! the more brilliantly you are placed now, the more certain is
your ruin.</p>
<br>
<h3>MAGDA.</h3>
<p class="normal">[<i>Madly</i>.] And if I wish for ruin! If I--</p>
<br>
<h3>VON KELLER.</h3>
<p class="normal">For Heaven's sake, hush! some one's coming.</p>
<br>
<h3>MAGDA.</h3>
<p class="normal">[<i>Springing up</i>.] Let them come! Let them all come! I don't care, I
don't care! To their faces I'll say what I think of you,--of you and
your respectable society. Why should I be worse than you, that I must
prolong my existence among you by a lie! Why should this gold upon my
body, and the lustre which surrounds my name, only increase my infamy?
Have I not worked early and late for ten long years? Have I not woven
this dress with sleepless nights? Have I not built up my career step by
step, like thousands of my kind? Why should I blush before any one? I
am myself, and through myself I have become what I am.</p>
<br>
<h3>VON KELLER.</h3>
<p class="normal">Good! You may stand there proudly, but you might at least consider--</p>
<br>
<h3>MAGDA.</h3>
<p class="normal">Whom? [<i>As he is silent</i>.] Whom? The pillar! Ha, ha! The pillar begins
to totter! Be easy, my dear friend. I am not revengeful. But when I
look at you in all your cowardly dignity--unwilling to take upon you
the slightest consequence of your doings, and contrast you with myself,
who sank through your love to be a pariah and an outcast-- Ah, I'm
ashamed of you. Pah!</p>
<br>
<h3>VON KELLER.</h3>
<p class="normal">For Heaven's sake! Your father! If he should see you like this!</p>

<p class="normal">Magda, this gentleman asks for the honor-- [<i>As he sees the two
together, he looks with sudden anger from one to the other</i>.]</p>
<br>
<h3>MAGDA.</h3>
<p class="normal">[<i>Anxiously</i>.] Father?</p>
<br>
<h3>SCHWARTZE.</h3>
<p class="normal">Now everything's arranged. Don't make it too long! [<i>To </i><span class="sc">Magda</span>.] Yes,
everything's all right now.<span style="letter-spacing:10px">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span> [<i>Exit</i>.</p>
<br>
<h3>VON KELLER.</h3>
<p class="normal">Ah, my dearest Magda, who could have suspected it?</p>
<br>
<h3>MAGDA.</h3>
<p class="normal">Then we are to be married.</p>
<br>
<h3>VON KELLER.</h3>
<p class="normal">Above all, I don't want you to entertain the idea that any design of
mine has been at the bottom of this development which I welcome so
gladly, which I--</p>
<br>
<h3>MAGDA.</h3>
<p class="normal">I haven't reproached you.</p>
<br>
<h3>VON KELLER.</h3>
<p class="normal">No, you have no reason.</p>
<br>
<h3>MAGDA.</h3>
<p class="normal">None whatever.</p>
<br>
<h3>VON KELLER.</h3>
<p class="normal">Let me further say to you that it has always been my strongest wish
that Providence might bring us together again.</p>
<br>
<h3>MAGDA.</h3>
<p class="normal">Then you have really never ceased to love me?</p>
<br>
<h3>VON KELLER.</h3>
<p class="normal">Well, as an honorable man and without exaggeration I can scarcely
assert that. But since early this morning a holier and a more
auspicious resolution has arisen within me--</p>
<br>
<h3>MAGDA.</h3>
<p class="normal">Pardon me, would this holy and auspicious resolution have arisen within
you just the same if I had come back to my home in poverty and shame?</p>
<br>
<h3>VON KELLER.</h3>
<p class="normal">My dearest Magda, I am neither self-seeking nor a fortune-hunter, but I
know what is due to myself and to my position. In other circumstances
there would have been no social possibility of making legitimate our
old relations--</p>
<br>
<h3>MAGDA.</h3>
<p class="normal">I must consider myself, then, very happy in these ten long years to
have worked up unconsciously towards such a high goal.</p>
<br>
<h3>VON KELLER.</h3>
<p class="normal">I don't know whether I am too sensitive, but that sounds almost like
irony. And I hardly think that--</p>
<br>
<h3>MAGDA.</h3>
<p class="normal">That it is fitting from me?</p>
<br>
<h3>VON KELLER.</h3>
<p class="normal">[<i>Deprecatingly</i>.] Oh!</p>
<br>
<h3>MAGDA.</h3>
<p class="normal">I must ask for your indulgence. The role of a patient and forbearing
wife is new to me. Let us speak, then, of the future [<i>sits and motions
to him to do the same</i>]--of our future. What is your idea of what is to
come?</p>
<br>
<h3>VON KELLER.</h3>
<p class="normal">You know, my dearest Magda, I have great designs. This provincial town
is no field for my statesmanship. Besides, it is my duty now to find a
place which will be worthy of your social talents. For you will give up
the stage and concert-hall,--that goes without saying.</p>
<br>
<h3>MAGDA.</h3>
<p class="normal">Oh, that goes without saying?</p>
<br>
<h3>VON KELLER.</h3>
<p class="normal">Oh, I beseech you--you don't understand the conditions; it would be a
fatal handicap for me. I might as well leave the service at once.</p>
<br>
<h3>MAGDA.</h3>
<p class="normal">And if you did?</p>
<br>
<h3>VON KELLER.</h3>
<p class="normal">Oh, you can't be in earnest. For a hardworking and ambitious man who
sees a brilliant future before him to give up honor and position, and
as his wife's husband to play the vagabond,--to live merely as the
husband of his wife? Shall I turn over your music, or take the tickets
at the box-office? No, my dearest friend, you underestimate me, and the
position I fill in society. But don't be uneasy. You will have nothing
to repent of. I have every respect for your past triumphs, but
[<i>pompously</i>] the highest reward to which your feminine ambition can
aspire will be achieved in the drawing-room.</p>
<br>
<h3>MAGDA.</h3>
<p class="normal">[<i>Aside</i>.] Good Heaven, this thing I'm doing is mere madness!</p>
<br>
<h3>VON KELLER.</h3>
<p class="normal">What do you say? [<span class="sc">Magda </span><i>shakes her head</i>.] And then the wife, the
ideal wife, of modern times is the consort, the true, self-sacrificing
helper of her husband. For instance, you, by your queenly personality
and by the magic of your voice, will overcome my enemies, and knit even
my friends more closely to me. And we will be largely hospitable. Our
house shall be the centre of the most distinguished society, who still
keep to the severely gracious manners of our forefathers. Gracious and
severe may seem contradictory terms, but they are not.</p>
<br>
<h3>MAGDA.</h3>
<p class="normal">You forget that the child on whose account this union is to be
consummated will keep the severely inclined away from us.</p>
<br>
<h3>VON KELLER.</h3>
<p class="normal">Yes, I know, dear Magda, it will be painful for you; but this child
must of course remain the deepest secret between us. No one must
suspect--</p>
<br>
<h3>MAGDA.</h3>
<p class="normal">[<i>Astounded and incredulous</i>.] What--what do you say?</p>
<br>
<h3>VON KELLER.</h3>
<p class="normal">Why, it would ruin us. No, no, it is absurd to think of it. But we can
make a little journey every year to wherever it is being educated. One
can register under a false name; that is not unusual in foreign parts,
and is hardly criminal. And when we are fifty years old, and other
regular conditions have been fulfilled, [<i>laughing</i>], that can be
arranged, can't it? Then we can, under some pretext, adopt it, can't
we?</p>
<br>
<h3>MAGDA.</h3>
<p class="normal">[<i>Breaks into a piercing laugh; then, with clasped hands and
staring eyes</i>.] My sweet! My little one! <i>Mio bambino! Mio
povero</i>--<i>bam</i>--you--you--I am to--ha, ha, ha! [<i>Tries to open the
folding door</i>.] Go! go!</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><i>Enter </i><span class="sc">Schwartze</span>.</p>
<br>
<h3>SCHWARTZE.</h3>
<p class="normal">What--</p>
<br>
<h3>MAGDA.</h3>
<p class="normal">Good you're here! Free me from this man, take this man away from me.</p>
<br>
<h3>SCHWARTZE.</h3>
<p class="normal">What?</p>
<br>
<h3>MAGDA.</h3>
<p class="normal">I have done everything you demanded. I have humbled myself, I have
surrendered my judgment, I have let myself be carried like a lamb to
the slaughter. But my child I will not leave. Give up my child to save
his career! [<i>Throws herself into a chair</i>.]</p>
<br>
<h3>SCHWARTZE.</h3>
<p class="normal">Mr. von Keller, will you please--</p>
<br>
<h3>VON KELLER.</h3>
<p class="normal">I am inconsolable, Colonel. But it seems that the conditions which for
the interest of both parties I had to propose, do not meet the
approbation--</p>
<br>
<h3>SCHWARTZE.</h3>
<p class="normal">My daughter is no longer in the position to choose the conditions under
which she-- Dr. von Keller, I ask your pardon for the scene to which
you have just been subjected. Wait for me at your home. I will myself
bring you my daughter's consent. For that I pledge you my word of
honor. [<i>Sensation</i>. <span class="sc">Magda </span><i>rises quickly</i>.]</p>
<br>
<h3>VON KELLER.</h3>
<p class="normal">Have you considered what--</p>
<br>
<h3>SCHWARTZE.</h3>
<p class="normal">[<i>Holding out his hand</i>.] I thank you, Dr. von Keller.</p>
<br>
<h3>VON KELLER.</h3>
<p class="normal">Not at all. I have only done my duty.</p>

<p class="right">[<i>Exit, with a bow</i>.</p>
<br>
<h3>MAGDA.</h3>
<p class="normal">[<i>Stretching herself</i>.] So! Now I'm the old Magda again. [Schwartze
<i>locks the three doors silently</i>.] Do you think, father, that I shall
become docile by being shut up?</p>
<br>
<h3>SCHWARTZE.</h3>
<p class="normal">So! Now we are alone. No one sees us but He who sees us--there
[<i>pointing upward</i>] Quiet yourself, my child. We must talk together.</p>
<br>
<h3>MAGDA.</h3>
<p class="normal">[<i>Sits down</i>.] Good! We can come to an understanding, then,--my home
and I.</p>
<br>
<h3>SCHWARTZE.</h3>
<p class="normal">Do you see that I am now quite calm?</p>
<br>
<h3>MAGDA.</h3>
<p class="normal">Certainly.</p>
<br>
<h3>SCHWARTZE.</h3>
<p class="normal">Quite calm, am I not? Even my arm does not tremble. What has happened,
has happened. But just now I gave your betrothed--</p>
<br>
<h3>MAGDA.</h3>
<p class="normal">My betrothed?-- Father dear!</p>
<br>
<h3>SCHWARTZE.</h3>
<p class="normal">I gave your betrothed my word of honor. And that must be kept, don't
you see?</p>
<br>
<h3>MAGDA.</h3>
<p class="normal">But if it is not in your power, my dear father.</p>
<br>
<h3>SCHWARTZE.</h3>
<p class="normal">Then I must die,--then I must simply die. One cannot live on when
one-- You are an officer's daughter. Don't you understand that?</p>
<br>
<h3>MAGDA.</h3>
<p class="normal">[<i>Compassionately</i>.] My God!</p>
<br>
<h3>SCHWARTZE.</h3>
<p class="normal">But before I die, I must set my home in order, must I not? Every one
has something which he holds sacred. What is sacred to your inmost
soul?</p>
<br>
<h3>MAGDA.</h3>
<p class="normal">My art.</p>
<br>
<h3>SCHWARTZE.</h3>
<p class="normal">No, that is not enough. It must be more sacred.</p>
<br>
<h3>MAGDA.</h3>
<p class="normal">My child.</p>
<br>
<h3>SCHWARTZE.</h3>
<p class="normal">Good! Your child,--your child,--you love it? [<span class="sc">Magda </span><i>nods</i>.] You wish
to see it again? [<i>She nods</i>.] And--yes--if you made an oath upon its
head [<i>makes a motion as if he laid his hand upon a child's head</i>],
then you would not perjure yourself? [<span class="sc">Magda </span><i>shakes her head, smiling</i>.]
That's well. [<i>Rising</i>.] Either you swear to me now, as upon his head,
that you will become the honorable wife of his father, or--neither of
us two shall go out of this room alive. [<i>Sinks back on the seat</i>.]</p>
<br>
<h3>MAGDA.</h3>
<p class="normal">[<i>After a short silence</i>.] My poor, dear papa! Why do you torture
yourself so? And do you think that I will let myself be constrained by
locked doors? You cannot believe it.</p>
<br>
<h3>SCHWARTZE.</h3>
<p class="normal">You will see.</p>
<br>
<h3>MAGDA.</h3>
<p class="normal">[<i>In growing excitement</i>.] And what do you really want of me? Why do
you trouble yourself about me? I had almost said, what have you all to
do with me?</p>
<br>
<h3>SCHWARTZE.</h3>
<p class="normal">That you will see.</p>
<br>
<h3>MAGDA.</h3>
<p class="normal">You blame me for living out my life without asking you and the whole
family for permission. And why should I not? Was I not without family?
Did you not send me out into the world to earn my bread, and then
disown me because the way in which I earned it was not to your taste?
Whom did I harm? Against whom did I sin? Oh, if I had remained the
daughter of the house, like Marie, who is nothing and does nothing
without the sheltering roof of the home, who passes straight from the
arms of her father into the arms of her husband; who receives from the
family life, thought, character, everything,--yes, then you would have
been right. In such a one the slightest error would have ruined
everything,--conscience, honor, self-respect. But I? Look at me. I was
alone. I was as shelterless as a man knocked about in the world,
dependent on the work of my own hands. If you give us the right to
hunger--and I have hungered--why do you deny us the right to love, as
we can find it, and to happiness, as we can understand it?</p>
<br>
<h3>SCHWARTZE.</h3>
<p class="normal">You think, my child, because you are free and a great artist, that you
can set at naught--</p>
<br>
<h3>MAGDA.</h3>
<p class="normal">Leave art out of the question. Consider me nothing more than the
seamstress or the servant-maid who seeks, among strangers, the little
food and the little love she needs. See how much the family with its
morality demand from us! It throws us on our own resources, it gives us
neither shelter nor happiness, and yet, in our loneliness, we must live
according to the laws which it has planned for itself alone. We must
still crouch in the corner, and there wait patiently until a respectful
wooer happens to come. Yes, wait. And meanwhile the war for existence
of body and soul is consuming us. Ahead we see nothing but sorrow and
despair, and yet shall we not once dare to give what we have of youth
and strength to the man for whom our whole being cries? Gag us, stupefy
us, shut us up in harems or in cloisters--and that perhaps would be
best. But if you give us our freedom, do not wonder if we take
advantage of it.</p>
<br>
<h3>SCHWARTZE.</h3>
<p class="normal">There, there! That is the spirit of rebellion abroad in the world. My
child--my dear child--tell me that you were not in earnest--that
you--that you--pity me--if-- [<i>Looking for the pistol-case</i>]. I don't
know what may happen--child--have pity on me!</p>
<br>
<h3>MAGDA.</h3>
<p class="normal">Father, father, be calm, I cannot bear that.</p>
<br>
<h3>SCHWARTZE.</h3>
<p class="normal">I will not do it--I cannot do it-- [<i>Looking still for the
pistol-case.</i>] Take it from me! Take it from me!</p>
<br>
<h3>MAGDA.</h3>
<p class="normal">What, father?</p>
<br>
<h3>SCHWARTZE.</h3>
<p class="normal">Nothing, nothing, nothing. I ask you for the last time.</p>
<br>
<h3>MAGDA.</h3>
<p class="normal">Then you persist in it?</p>
<br>
<h3>SCHWARTZE.</h3>
<p class="normal">My child, I warn you. You know I cannot do otherwise.</p>
<br>
<h3>MAGDA.</h3>
<p class="normal">Yes, father, you leave me no other way. Well, then, are you sure that
you ought to force me upon this man--[<span class="sc">Schwartze </span><i>listens</i>] that,
according to your standards, I am altogether worthy of him?
[<i>Hesitating, looking into space</i>.] I mean--that he was the only one in
my life?</p>
<br>
<h3>SCHWARTZE.</h3>
<p class="normal">[<i>Feels for the pistol-case and takes the pistol out</i>.] You jade! [<i>He
advances upon her, trying to raise the weapon. At the same moment he
falls back on the seat, where he remains motionless, with staring eyes,

<br>

<p class="normal">[<i>With a loud cry</i>.] Father! [<i>She flies toward the stove for shelter

<p class="normal">Leopold, what's the matter? Leopold! [<i>To the </i><span class="sc">Pastor</span>.] O my God, he's

<p class="normal">Papa dear! Speak, one word! [<i>Throws herself down at his right</i>.]</p>
<br>
<h3>HEFFTERDINGT.</h3>
<p class="normal">Get the doctor, Max.</p>
<br>
<h3>MAX.</h3>
<p class="normal">Is it a stroke?</p>
<br>
<h3>HEFFTERDINGT.</h3>
<p class="normal">I think so. [<i>Exit </i><span class="sc">Max</span>. <i>Aside to </i><span class="sc">Magda</span>.] Come to him. [<i>As she

<br>
<h3>MRS. SCHWARTZE.</h3>
<p class="normal">[<i>Who has tried to take the pistol</i>.] Let it go, Leopold; what do you
want with it? See, he's holding the pistol and won't let it go.</p>
<br>

<p class="normal">[<i>Aside</i>.] It is the convulsion. He cannot. My dear old friend, can you
understand what I'm saying to you? [<span class="sc">Schwartze </span><i>bows his head a little</i>.
